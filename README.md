# 🧠 PLAGIA-GUARD: A Machine Learning-Based Plagiarism Detection Tool

## 📌 Project Overview

**PLAGIA-GUARD** is a comprehensive web-based tool designed to detect plagiarism using advanced machine learning techniques. It ensures the **originality and integrity** of written content by integrating both **traditional statistical methods** and **cutting-edge deep learning models**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **TF-IDF Vectorization** for initial similarity scoring  
- 🤖 **BERT-based Sentence Transformers** for semantic analysis  
- 🧹 **Robust Preprocessing Pipeline**: text cleaning, punctuation removal, case normalization, stop word elimination  
- 📊 **Similarity Score Generation** using both lexical and contextual understanding  
- 🌐 **Web Interface** built using Streamlit for real-time plagiarism checks  
- 🎯 **Support for Paraphrase Detection**, not just copy-paste

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Sentence Transformers (BERT)**
- **PyPDF2**
- **Streamlit**

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean the input text by removing noise like punctuation, stop words, and normalize casing.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Use **TF-IDF** for extracting lexical similarity
   - Use **BERT** embeddings for semantic similarity
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Apply cosine similarity to both vector spaces.
4. **Result Display**: Show similarity score and highlight potential plagiarism regions via the web interface.
